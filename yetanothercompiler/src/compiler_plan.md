# Comprehensive Plan for Python 2.0 Compiler in Rust

## Plan:

1. **Lexer Implementation**:
   - Extend the existing `Lexer` in `lexer.rs` to recognize Python-specific tokens, including:
     - Keywords (e.g., `def`, `class`, `if`, `else`, `while`, etc.)
     - Identifiers (variable names, function names)
     - Operators (arithmetic, logical, comparison)
     - Punctuation (parentheses, commas, colons, etc.)
   - Implement a method to handle multi-character tokens (e.g., `==`, `!=`, etc.).

2. **Parser Implementation**:
   - Create a new `Parser` struct that will utilize the extended `Lexer`.
   - Implement methods to parse different constructs in Python, such as:
     - Function definitions
     - Control flow statements (if, for, while)
     - Expressions and statements
   - Build an abstract syntax tree (AST) to represent the parsed code structure.

3. **Semantic Analysis**:
   - Implement semantic checks to ensure the correctness of the code, such as:
     - Type checking
     - Scope resolution
     - Variable declaration and usage checks

4. **Code Generation**:
   - Implement a code generation module that converts the AST into LLVM IR or another suitable intermediate representation.
   - Ensure that the generated code can be compiled into executables.

5. **Testing**:
   - Create unit tests for each component (lexer, parser, semantic analysis, code generation).
   - Perform integration testing to ensure all components work together correctly.
   - Use a test suite to validate the compiler against various Python 2.0 code samples.

6. **Documentation**:
   - Write clear and concise comments throughout the code.
   - Document the structure and usage of the compiler in a README file.

7. **Version Control**:
   - Use Git for version control, committing changes regularly with meaningful commit messages.

## Follow-up Steps:
- Begin implementing the lexer and parser based on the outlined plan.
- Regularly test each component as it is developed to ensure functionality.
